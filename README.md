# Overview

## _**www.aidanjrauscher.com**_ 

In order to become comfortable HTML and CSS (and eventually JavaScript), I built my first website. 

I was inspired by the tutorial provided by FreeCodeCamp.org in their Responsive Web Design course. 

In order to gain some familiarity with hosting services, I made the website live, and currently host it through DreamHost. 

#### Update Plams
I will work to improve the responsiveness of the website so that it is more mobile friendly. 

I will work to extend the profile section, and the projects section to be more inclusive of my experience. 

I will work to incorporate JS into the website for practice. 

I *may* work to add some form of backend database connection using MySQL.
